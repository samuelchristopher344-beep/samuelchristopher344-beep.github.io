    <h1>What Is Google AdSense and How Does It Work?</h1>

    <p>
      Google AdSense is an advertising program that allows website owners to earn
      money by displaying ads on their websites. These ads are provided and
      managed by Google.
    </p>

    <p>
      When visitors view or click on ads shown on a website, the website owner
      earns a small amount of revenue. The ads shown are usually related to the
      website content.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be approved for AdSense, a website must have original content, clear
      navigation, and important pages like a Privacy Policy and Contact page.
    </p>

    <p>
      AdSense works best for websites that focus on quality content and user
      experience rather than trying to force ads everywhere.
